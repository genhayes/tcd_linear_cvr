# tcd_linear_cvr

This repository contains the scripts and functions used to derive cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) metrics from cerebral blood velocities measured using transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound during a boxcar CO2 gas delivery protocol.

A 2 MHz pulsed transcranial Doppler ultrasound system (7760EN Doppler-BoxX Digital, Compumedics DWL) was used to measure cerebral blood velocities. CO2 and O2 were measured with an infrared gas analyser (CD202..02.EN Normocap Oxy Monitor, Datex-Ohmeda Engstrom) as surrogates of PaCO2 and PaO2.
